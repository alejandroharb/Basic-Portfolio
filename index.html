                <p>Hi there, <br> Thanks for wanting to learn about me! I'm currently learning to program. My ambitions are to truly master the craft of Web programming and back-end software engineering. I'm interested in the health industry. There's so much need for problem solving within the industry, and tech has been showing great promise to bring about creative solutions! <br><br><br> In the health industry, I'm interested in genetic data storage and analytics. Taking it a step farther, I'm interested in personalized medicine, by pharmaceutical data analytics. This uses the genetics discussed earlier, and the use of pharmaceutical data of mass populations, to better understand optimal doses, specific medicines, and length of treatment.</p>
